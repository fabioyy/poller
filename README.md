Package poller is an epoll(7)-based file-descriptor multiplexer. It
allows concurent Read and Write operations from and to multiple
file-descriptors without allocating one OS thread for every blocked
operation. It behaves similarly to Go's netpoller (which
multiplexes network connections) without requiring special support
from the Go runtime. It can be used with tty devices, character
devices, pipes, FIFOs, and any Unix file-descriptor that is
poll(7)-able. In addition it allows the user to set timeouts
(deadlines) to read and write operations.
